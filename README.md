# DS5111 Journal
# Computer ID: svz5ya


This journal documents my experience in the DS5111 class, detailing activities in each module, new concepts, and code learned, as well as the completion of exercises and labs. The content reflects my personal opinions and understanding of the class topics.

## Module 1: Git Fundamentals, Setting up GitHub Repository, and AWS Login

In the initial module, we focused on setting up a GIT repository and AWS, with a particular emphasis on EC2 instances. While I was familiar with GIT, this marked my first encounter with EC2 instances, involving the creation of makefiles and the use of vim and make commands. Working on a Windows system presented challenges, necessitating the use of the PuTTY program to connect to EC2 instances.

## Module 2: Software Skills Part I

This module delved deeper into working with EC2, introducing concepts such as assertions, pytest, and pylint. Creating a directory structure for testing was also covered. Although it took some time to get everything running in Software Skills I, I found the experience enjoyable.

## Module 3: Software Skills Part II

Here, we explored using the Windows command prompt to log into EC2 instances and employed Tmux. Successfully opening Jupyter notebooks in EC2 via SSH and Tmux was a notable accomplishment.

## Module 4: Software Skills Part III

Module 4 extended our knowledge of the Tmux shell, with practical testing of Tmux shells and running Python code. This was novel for me, as I typically run Python on my machine or in online Jupyter notebooks.

## Module 5: Software Testing

In Module 5, the focus shifted to testing skills, with experimentation on test_perceptron. Conducting tests on passing and failing examples was particularly intriguing, despite initial challenges in getting the program to work in the lab.

## Module 6: CICD

Module 6 introduced code automation, covering YAML and its application in running tests within GitHub. While many concepts were presented, I felt a need for more comprehensive examples or exercises related to this topic.

## Module 7: Create and Deploy Containers

The seventh module centered on containers, highlighting the subtle differences between containers and virtual machines. Understanding that containers share the same OS while virtual machines have their own OS was a key takeaway.

## Module 8: Database Design

Module 8 delved into database design, exploring differences between relational and non-relational databases, and covering fundamental database objects like primary and foreign keys. Having previous experience with databases, I found this module to be a refresher.

## Module 10: DBT - Module 12: DBT and Snowflake Lab Overview

In Module 10, we delved into DBT (Data Build Tool) and its integration with Snowflake. Setting up DBT in an EC2 virtual environment, creating models from seed data, and understanding the role of dbt_project.yml were key aspects. Module 12 provided further insights into connecting DBT with Snowflake, including a practical example that facilitated successful configuration and testing of models.

## Module 11: Overview of Snowflake and Docker Lab

The eleventh module focused on Docker containers, demonstrating how to run Docker in a t2.large EC2 environment. Although the lab was interesting, challenges arose in generating an image using the make run command.

The journal concludes with important codes for connecting to EC2 and GIT repositories, offering step-by-step instructions for establishing connections.

In summary, the class was an enjoyable learning experience, covering diverse concepts and enhancing software skills. The author acknowledges the need for additional practice, especially in DBT-Snowflake database work and Docker-related tasks.
